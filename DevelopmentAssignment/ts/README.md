To use, create a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`, which you
can obtain from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), or otherwise add
it to your environment.

Then place your inputs inside `inputs/` as `input1.txt`,
`input2.txt` and `input3.txt`. Then run

```sh
docker compose up
```

You can find your outputs in `outputs/`
